# PDF Processing and LLM Analysis System

## Overview
This project is an automated **PDF processing system** that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for document analysis. It enables text extraction from PDFs, batch processing, interactive Q&A, and structured Markdown report generation. The system is designed for **academic research**, supporting multilingual analysis in **English and Chinese** using **iFLYTEK Spark 4.0 Ultra** via a **WebSocket API**.

## Features
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses `PDFMiner` for high-accuracy text retrieval.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple PDF files simultaneously without interruptions.
- **LLM Integration**: Analyzes extracted content with `SparkApi.py`, enabling deep document understanding.
- **Interactive Q&A Mode**: Users can query processed content in real-time.
- **Markdown Report Generation**: Saves structured analysis results in `.md` format.
- **Error Handling and Resilience**:
  - Logs and manages errors (e.g., corrupted files, LLM timeouts).
  - Prevents a single failure from halting the entire batch process.
  - Provides real-time feedback to users.
